# HumanityHouse-WebApp
Humanity House is a web application designed to facilitate charity events for NGOs and provide a platform for donors to contribute to specific causes. NGOs can create and manage events on the platform, while donors can browse events and donate funds. Currently, there is no payment gateway integrated into the platform. Humanity House is built using technologies such as Spring Boot, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, and JavaScript(ReactJS18) and for database connectivity, MySQL is used.
